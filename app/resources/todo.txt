<--+ AngularJs +-->

[Required]
Dependency injection
Directive
Filter
Service
Provider
Factory
Constant
--> Value (I didn't find difference between the value and constants)
Template

Think about clear routing
Think about different environments
Think about redirect in case of typed url
Case insensitive
Fix background image
Migrate to npm install
Write some test
Break down details controller

Issue understood:
Use directive within controller to represent different region content in the single view. Directive has own scope and own little view.
Factory returns an function. Service return an object.

[Optional]
Angular 2.0 -> @component, @directive, templates, DI
